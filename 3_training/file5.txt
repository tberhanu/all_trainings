1) Count Capital Letters
Write a one-liner that will count the number of capital letters in a file. Your code should work even if the file is too big to fit in memory.
Assume you have an open file handle object, such as: with open(SOME_LARGE_FILE) as fh:
count = # your code here
2) You left your computer unlocked and your friend decided to troll you by copying a lot of your files to
random spots all over your file system.
Even worse, she saved the duplicate files with random, embarrassing names ("this_is_like_a_digital_wedgie.txt" was clever, I'll give her that).
Write a function that returns a list of all the duplicate files. We'll check them by hand before actually deleting them, since programmatically deleting files is really scary. To help us confirm that two files are actually duplicates, return a list of tuples ↴ where:
• the first item is the duplicate file • the second item is the original file
For example:
